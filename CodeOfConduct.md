# Code of Conduct

All participants of Decent Diaspora are expected to abide by our Code of Conduct, both online and during in-person events that are hosted and/or associated with Decentespresso and its respective community.

### The Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we pledge to make participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

Diaspora and related platforms are meant to be a happy place where we discuss coffee, technology, and related topics.

It’s meant to be a community that’s fun to be in, not divisive, where we unite around our common interests.

As such, we generally avoid divisive topics such as politics, gender, religion and nationality unless directly related to our common interest in coffee. There are lots of places where those conversations can be had, so we don’t need to talk about them here.

If there’s one cardinal rule, it’s “never be disrespectful”.

Below you’ll find some examples and explanations of what we think is not ok.

However, if you guide yourself along the general rules of being respectful and avoiding divisive topics, you’ll find Diaspora to be a lot of fun and we hope you’ll get a lot out of it.

### The Standards

Examples of behaviour that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Attributing other peoples work
- Respecting different cultural backgrounds and preferences
- Teaching others without expecting absolute agreement
- "No means no"
- Referring to people by their preferred pronouns and using gender-neutral pronouns when uncertain
- Focusing on what is best for the community

#### Examples of unacceptable behaviour by participants include:
